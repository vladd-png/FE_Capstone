## What is your greatest strength, and how do you know it? ##
  I believe my greatest strength is my intelligence. I easily do well in school, I am quick to pick things up, and I love problem solving puzzles. I have relied on my intelligence to get me far in life, both at work and in relationships. I can't say I know this is my greatest strength, but I would assume it is because of how much I cherish and rely on it. I love to learn and be in situations that are mentally challenging and rigorous, so as to keep excericising my brain. One of my favorite quotes relates to this: "If you find yourself to be the smartest one in the room, you're in the wrong room."

## How do you work best? ##
  I work great in groups and independently, though I would say I work *best* in a small group with individuals who are equally driven to solve the problem at hand. I appreciate groups because it's the ~~only~~ best way to bounce your ideas around, develop and collaborate on solutions, and gain a more in-depth solution overall. I appreciate working alone as well, because I am very driven and when a teammate does not want to pull weight or contribute I get frustrated personally. I prefer small groups to big groups because I feel more people are heard, and you can have more of a voice in a small (under 10) group. 
  
## What is your greatest area of improvement? ##
  I am stubborn and at times arrogant to how I am percieved by others. I have, on many occassions, missed out on great ideas from others, simply because I was sure my solution was great. I am not proud of this quality, but I know I have it and I am trying to be more conscious of it. I do not want to be arrogant in my intelligence that I miss out on other solutions new to me. I need to learn to step back, listen to others, and give the chance to another to solve the problem, especially if I have a solution already.
  
## How to you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development? ##
  I am excited to learn! When I first started learning code, it was beyond interesting to me, I was passionate about it. I saw it as learning a new language. I want to be fluent in my coding and my ability to control what happens on my screen. I am eager and capable of accomplishing this task. I plan to practice daily on my area of greatest improvement, as stated above, and on my coding homework. I know I will face challenges and problems I cannot overcome alone, but I am so eager to try and fail and try again. I won't easily give up, I'm too passionate about learning. 

## How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer? ##
  I know how I prefer to work, and with whom I prefer working with. I know my learning style, and the challenges I have faced before. I have a drive to overcome issues I will face, and frankly I am a freindly person and have no issue reaching out for help. Being aware of my personal strengths and working preferences is monumental going into a program like Turing. It helps to build a solid foundation that I can grow from. If I know how I work best, I won't be distracted or frustrated trying to solve daily problems or tasks.
